Report which databases, APIs, and indexes were searched—and what parts of the literature they do (and do not) cover.

**Why this matters**

- **Interpretable scope:** Coverage determines what your evidence base can legitimately claim (and what it cannot).
- **Publisher and access bias:** Some sources are skewed toward particular publishers, regions, venues, or document types.
- **Open-access constraints:** API-based and LLM-supported workflows may disproportionately rely on open-access or freely retrievable content, which can systematically exclude paywalled literature and bias conclusions.

**Practical implementation**

- List every source searched (database/API), the date(s) of search, and the exact query version used.
- Describe key coverage characteristics (e.g., disciplines, publication types, language/region, major publisher concentration).
- Explicitly state access limitations (e.g., “API returns only open metadata,” “full texts available primarily for OA items,” “LLM extraction limited to accessible PDFs”).
- Where feasible, triangulate across complementary sources (e.g., bibliographic index + publisher-agnostic registry) and document the rationale.
