Publish the review’s curated datasets (metadata, screening decisions, extraction forms, and synthesis-ready evidence tables) so others can inspect, reuse, and extend the evidence base.

**Why this matters**

- **Transparency and credibility:** Shared data allows readers to verify how conclusions follow from the underlying evidence.
- **Cumulative research:** Reusable datasets reduce duplicated effort and enable incremental updates, replications, and new syntheses.
- **Method learning and benchmarking:** Open artifacts support training, tool comparison, and community improvement of review workflows.

**Practical implementation**

- Publish data in a **public repository** with clear structure (raw inputs, primary records, protocols, derived outputs) and version history.
- Include **documentation**: README, data dictionary/schemas, and a short description of how to reproduce key outputs (e.g., PRISMA, tables, figures).
- Provide **persistent references** where possible (release tags / archived snapshots) and recommended citation information.
- Share reuse-critical artifacts explicitly (e.g., `records.bib`, screening decisions, extraction templates, evidence tables) while respecting licensing and access constraints.
- Add contribution guidance (issues/PR workflow) to support corrections, extensions, and periodic updates.
