papers:
- study_id: rosenblat2018uber
  citation_key: RosenblatEtAl2018
  year: 2018
  platform: Uber
  platform_type: ride_hailing
  method: qualitative_field_study
  data: interviews
  sample: drivers
  bias_type: algorithmic_visibility_bias
  bias_mechanism: algorithmic_matching_and_ranking
  evidence_level: strong
  outcome_affected: task_access
  direction_of_bias: favors_highly_visible_workers
  key_result: Algorithmic control mechanisms differentially allocate rides, reinforcing cumulative advantage among drivers.
  notes: Visibility bias is opaque to workers and difficult to contest.
- study_id: cook2018airbnb
  citation_key: CookEtAl2018
  year: 2018
  platform: Airbnb
  platform_type: accommodation
  method: audit_experiment
  data: field_experiment
  sample: hosts
  bias_type: rating_bias
  bias_mechanism: customer_discrimination
  evidence_level: strong
  outcome_affected: booking_probability
  direction_of_bias: disadvantages_minority_hosts
  key_result: Hosts with African-American–sounding names receive fewer bookings and lower ratings despite equivalent offerings.
  notes: Bias is mediated through customer choice rather than platform rules alone.
- study_id: hannak2017bias
  citation_key: HannakEtAl2017
  year: 2017
  platform: multiple
  platform_type: online_marketplaces
  method: algorithmic_audit
  data: large_scale_observational
  sample: workers
  bias_type: rating_bias
  bias_mechanism: subjective_evaluations
  evidence_level: strong
  outcome_affected: reputation_scores
  direction_of_bias: systematic_demographic_distortion
  key_result: Online reputation systems encode demographic biases even when service quality is controlled.
  notes: Demonstrates structural bias rather than isolated discrimination.
- study_id: wood2019global
  citation_key: WoodEtAl2019
  year: 2019
  platform: multiple
  platform_type: online_labor
  method: mixed_methods
  data: surveys_and_interviews
  sample: global_workers
  bias_type: geographic_bias
  bias_mechanism: client_location_preferences
  evidence_level: strong
  outcome_affected: wages
  direction_of_bias: disadvantages_global_south_workers
  key_result: Workers in low-income countries receive systematically lower pay and fewer high-value tasks.
  notes: Bias persists even when skills and experience are comparable.
- study_id: kuehl2022entry
  citation_key: KuehlEtAl2022
  year: 2022
  platform: freelance_marketplace
  platform_type: online_freelance
  method: longitudinal_analysis
  data: platform_logs
  sample: new_and_incumbent_workers
  bias_type: experience_lock_in_bias
  bias_mechanism: reputation_thresholds
  evidence_level: moderate_to_strong
  outcome_affected: matching_probability
  direction_of_bias: favors_incumbents
  key_result: Early experience thresholds significantly reduce entry opportunities for new workers.
  notes: Aligned with cumulative advantage dynamics.
