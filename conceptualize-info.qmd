Record metadata is curated as follows:

- Data retrieved in the search is stored in the [data/search](https://github.com/fs-ise/C5-DM-vignette/tree/main/data/search){target=_blank} directory; the [Git history of this path](https://github.com/fs-ise/C5-DM-vignette/commits/main/data/search){target=_blank} shows that the files were preserved in their original form, i.e., treated as raw data
- Records were imported into the [data/records.bib](https://github.com/fs-ise/C5-DM-vignette/blob/main/data/records.bib){target=_blank} as the primary data structure; the [Git history of this file](https://github.com/fs-ise/C5-DM-vignette/commits/main/data/records.bib){target=_blank} documents how each record evolved through the process (e.g., manual or computational change of metadata, merging of records, prescreening decisions)

For primary data (record metadata), the Bibtex format was chosen and consistent formatting was ensured by CoLRev [@WagnerPrester2025].
BibTex is machine readable and the changes can easily be interpreted when inspecting the git history.

Data was structured as follows:
