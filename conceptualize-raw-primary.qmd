Record metadata is curated as follows:

- Data retrieved in the search is stored in the [data/search](https://github.com/fs-ise/C5-DM-vignette/tree/main/data/search){target=_blank} directory; the [Git history of this path](https://github.com/fs-ise/C5-DM-vignette/commits/main/data/search){target=_blank} shows that the files were preserved in their original form, i.e., treated as raw data
- Records were imported into the [data/records.bib](https://github.com/fs-ise/C5-DM-vignette/blob/main/data/records.bib){target=_blank} as the primary data structure; the [Git history of this file](https://github.com/fs-ise/C5-DM-vignette/commits/main/data/records.bib){target=_blank} documents how each record evolved through the process (e.g., manual or computational change of metadata, merging of records, prescreening decisions)

For primary data (record metadata), the Bibtex format was chosen and consistent formatting was ensured by CoLRev [@WagnerPrester2025].
BibTex is machine readable and the changes can easily be interpreted when inspecting the git history.

Data was structured as follows:

Explicitly distinguish and connect *raw* data (as retrieved from sources) with *primary* data (the curated records used in the review).

**Why this matters**

- **Conceptual clarity:** Separating raw from primary records makes explicit which data are untouched inputs and which are analytically curated.
- **Traceability of evidence:** Each primary record can be traced back to its raw source, supporting transparency and auditability.
- **Interpretability of changes:** Clear links help reviewers and collaborators understand *how* and *why* records evolved over time.

**Practical implementation**

- Store **raw search outputs** unchanged in a dedicated directory (e.g., `data/search/`), preserving original formats and content.
- Import records into a **single primary data structure** (e.g., `data/records.bib`) that serves as the authoritative evidence base for the review.
- Use **BibTeX (`.bib`)** for primary record metadata to ensure machine readability and compatibility with tooling.
- Rely on version control to document record evolution (e.g., metadata corrections, merges, screening decisions) via the file’s commit history.
- Apply consistent formatting and normalization using automated tooling (e.g., CoLRev) to keep changes interpretable in Git diffs.
