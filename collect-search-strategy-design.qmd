Design search strategies that translate the review question into precise, reproducible query formulations across data sources.

**Why this matters**

- **Data-informed searching:** Effective strategies build on existing data—known queries, seed papers, and prior inclusion/exclusion decisions—to systematically improve recall and precision.
- **Transparency and reproducibility:** Explicit, well-documented queries allow others to understand, rerun, and assess the search.
- **Control over scope:** Data-driven refinement helps justify why certain literatures are included or excluded.

**Practical implementation**

- Define the **core concept(s)** and expand with **synonyms, spelling variants, and related terms** informed by prior reviews and seed sets.
- Use **known relevant and irrelevant papers** to iteratively test and refine queries.
- Adapt queries to each source (API/database fields, operators, limits) while keeping the conceptual structure consistent.
- Store final strategies as **structured, executable artifacts** (e.g., JSON query specifications) and version them together with the retrieved data.
