Use widely adopted, non-proprietary file formats to store and exchange review data (meta-data, protocols, evidence tables, and outputs).

**Why this matters**

- **Tool independence and longevity:** Standard formats reduce lock-in and keep the evidence usable even if specific tools change.
- **Quality control and validation:** Machine-readable formats enable automated checks (schema validation, linting, diffing) and make errors easier to detect.
- **Reproducibility and traceability:** Clean text-based formats integrate well with version control, so changes can be reviewed and compared reliably.

**Practical implementation**

- Use **BibTeX (`.bib`)** for bibliographic metadata and record-level information.
- Use **JSON (`.json`)** for structured artifacts such as search strategies and raw query specifications.
- Prefer plain-text formats that support **stable diffs** in Git, so even small changes remain visible and reviewable.
- Document expected fields and conventions (e.g., required BibTeX keys; JSON schemas for search strategies) to ensure consistency across contributors.
