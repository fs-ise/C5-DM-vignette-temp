Design data structures and representations that fit the *type of review* and the *intended analytical method*.

**Why this matters**

- **Methodological validity:** Different review types (systematic, scoping, bibliometric, qualitative synthesis) require different kinds and levels of structure.
- **Analytical leverage:** Well-aligned data structures make analyses possible without excessive transformation or ad-hoc workarounds.
- **Transparency and reuse:** When data reflects the logic of the method, others can more easily understand, reproduce, and extend the analysis.

**Practical implementation**

- Choose the **degree of structure** (unstructured → semi-structured → structured) in line with the review objective and method.
- Align **extraction fields and schemas** with planned analyses (e.g., variables for quantitative synthesis; concepts/mechanisms for qualitative synthesis).
- Make methodological assumptions explicit by encoding them directly in the data model.
- Revisit and adapt data structures if the review design evolves (e.g., from mapping to synthesis).

## Illustrations

The following examples illustrate how different review methodologies imply different data structures and analyses.

**Data extraction approaches**
- **Bibliometric data:** Structured citation, authorship, and venue data enabling network and trend analyses ([TODO](temp_file.txt)).
- **Emergent coding:** Semi-structured qualitative data following inductive coding principles (e.g., Gioia-style), supported by YAML-based workflows ([TODO](temp_file.txt)).

**Data analysis examples**
- **Bibliometric analysis:** Citation networks, co-authorship graphs, or thematic clusters derived from structured metadata.
- **Scoping review mapping:** Conceptual maps that organize themes and research streams without aggregating effect sizes.


For other review methodologies, different data extraction approaches must be considered.
The following examples were added for illustration purposes:

- Bibliometric data ([TODO](temp_file.txt){target=_blank}).
- Emergent coding ([TODO](temp_file.txt){target=_blank}) in line with the recommendations of @GioiaEtAl2013 and the YAML workflow of @Wang2022.

For other review methodologies, different data analysis approaches must be considered.
The following examples were added for illustration purposes:

- A bibliometric analysis:

```{python}
#| label: fig-citation-network
#| fig-cap: "Citation network (generated from [TODO](link))"
#| output-location: column
#| echo: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false

from pathlib import Path
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import networkx as nx

csv_path = Path("data/citation_edges.csv")
df = pd.read_csv(csv_path)

G = nx.from_pandas_edgelist(
    df,
    source="citing",
    target="cited",
    create_using=nx.DiGraph()
)

years = {}
years.update(dict(zip(df["citing"], df["citing_year"])))
years.update(dict(zip(df["cited"], df["cited_year"])))
nx.set_node_attributes(G, years, "year")

pos = nx.spring_layout(G, seed=7, k=0.6)

year_attr = nx.get_node_attributes(G, "year")

years_sorted = sorted({y for y in year_attr.values() if y is not None})
year_to_x = {y: i for i, y in enumerate(years_sorted)}

pos2 = nx.spring_layout(G, seed=7, k=0.6)
for n in G.nodes:
    y = year_attr.get(n)
    if y is not None:
        pos2[n][0] = year_to_x[y]

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
nx.draw_networkx_edges(G, pos2, arrows=True, arrowstyle="-|>", arrowsize=10, width=0.8, alpha=0.45)
nx.draw_networkx_nodes(G, pos2, node_size=280)
nx.draw_networkx_labels(G, pos2, font_size=7)
plt.title("Citation network (layered by year)")
plt.axis("off")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
