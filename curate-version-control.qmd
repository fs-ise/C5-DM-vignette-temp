<!--

Store data in a version-controlled folder (e.g., Git or a similar tool) to organize and keep track of all review materials.
Synchronize repositories to leverage the advantages of both local and remote repository management.

One place to store data (especially when working in a team)

Transparency of data changes

Enabling control (review, training and undoing changes)

Distributed version control: backup of data on multiple machines, and enabling the team to take advantage of local computational resources (typically cheaper for researchers) - e.g., for API querying, deduplication or advanced computational techniques (ML, LLM) that perform on the full-text documents

**Why it matters**

- **One shared place for the evidence base**: A single repository helps teams coordinate on the same (meta)data, protocols, and outputs.
- **Transparent change history**: Every modification is recorded (who changed what, when, and why), enabling traceability of the evolving evidence base.
- *Stronger control over data quality**: Version control supports review (e.g., pull requests), training/standardization of team practices, and reliable rollback/undo of problematic changes.

**Practical implementation**

- Maintain a **remote repository** (e.g., GitHub) for collaboration and backup, and **local clones** for day-to-day work and computation.
- Use **distributed version control** to leverage local computing resources (often cheaper and faster for researchers) for tasks like API querying, deduplication, and compute-intensive methods (ML/LLM) on full texts—while keeping results reproducible and auditable.
